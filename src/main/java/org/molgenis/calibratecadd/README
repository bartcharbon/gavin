1) get clinvar pathogenic, curate, write to a vcf file (e.g. 'clinvarpatho.vcf')
2) fix indel notation where possible by merging with "ClinVar VCF edition"
3) run snpeff on this file
4) load clinvar-snpeff vcf and from ExAC, get similar variants
5) write combined set to VCF and run though CADD web service
6) combine CADD output with original file and write data frame for R
7) basic results in the form of a table per gene
8) run R script to perform advanced statistics and pictures
